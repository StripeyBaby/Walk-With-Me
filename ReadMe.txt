===================
WALK WITH ME: v0.1
===================
This is a small two week project I made in Uni based on the promopt, 'Horror'. Probably won't follow up specifically with this but might adapt or adopt some features for another project.

SUMMARY:
This project was me mainly messing around with UI stuff like the song menu and character creation so theres no real 'game aspect' but this is a brief experience of what it felt like for me during Covid lockdown as I was trapped in my house and slowly going insane. Its more a immersive walking simulator with a lil 'button mash' game aspect to it.

HOW TO PLAY:
The controls are a bit funky with alternating between A and D to walk (like taking steps with each leg). To change between facing left and right use LEFT SHIFT. When you are at a door/doorway use W to enter and exit rooms and F will let you interact with certain objects to 'pass the time'. Lastly use S to open and close the music menu (escape key allows you to exit game).

X to start
Alternate between A & D to walk
LEFT SHIFT to change direction
W to enter and exit rooms
F to interact with certain objects
S to open/close music menu

INTERACTABLES:
Bed
Shower
Fridge
TV
(If you press F on a non-interactable object you will still be prompted)

FEATURES TO EXPAND:
- Movement that makes sense (A & D alternating like your legs)
- Subtle/niche horror (walking alone - train station, nature park, public toilet, hospital, city, alleyway)
- Character creation

INDEPTH WALKTHROUGH:
Dream/nightmare sequence
- A & D to take a couple steps
- See shadowy figure
- Mash A & D
- Reach lampost to escape
